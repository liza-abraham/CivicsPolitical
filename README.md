Do social characteristics and behavior predict presidential voter choice? We propose to find out through the following analysis. We selected this topic because in a politically polarized society, understanding underlying drivers for political decisions may be useful.

Kuriwaki, Shiro complied voter survey data in .Rds file format for the years 2006â€“2018. The dataframe contains 452,755 rows (observations) and 73 columns (features), including geographic, demographic, economic, news interest, political affinity, and presidential choice variables.

The data was drawn from Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES), one of the most comprehensive political surveys in the US.

We will refine the data for the most recent survey year (2018), which indicates presidential choice for 2016. Using R and machine learning, we will develop a predictive model for presidential choice.
